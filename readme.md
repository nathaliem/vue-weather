# Vue weather
Getting the current weather for your location (or one of your choice).

Again, playing around with VueJS. :)

@TODO:
* Make general layout/color changes
* Smoother loading of data
* Transition for toggle of form

## Development

Run `npm install`.

Copy the `src/config/keys.example.js` to a new file `src/config/keys.js` in the same folder and add your own keys accordingly.

Run `npm run serve`.

## Build

Run `vue-cli-service build` (assuming [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) is installed).
